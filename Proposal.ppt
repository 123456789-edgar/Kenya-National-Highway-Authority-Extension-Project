A proposal presentation on the Virtual weighbridge system by the Kenya National Highways Authority (Ext)
 

Virtual system Services
	Axle load control
	Tire detection.
	Enforcement, pre-selection and statics applications.
	Traffic counting and classification
 For more…
 
Limitations of the system
i.	the error of the scale.
ii.	Installation costs.
iii.	Congestion and delays at weighing points.
iv.	*Inconsistent readings.
 
Conclusion & Recommendations
	Phasing out of the	single axled scales in favor of either axle unit or multi deck scales.
	Need to adopt an appropriate strategy for deciding on the location and the number of weighbridges along the regional trunk and non trunk road networks.
 












Lidar Technology.
Light Detection and Ranging
 
NOMAD
Detecting multiple violations up to now is a big task. But with this device, which does employ the use of the lidar technology, it can be able to detect multiple violations of one or multiple vehicles, well aided by its internal configured car tracking mechanism.
It is equipped with a sensor Lidar 3D, which permits control of multiple violations including:
•	Speed measurement into the direction of traffic
•	Red light violation
•	Multiple lane crossing
•	Vehicle classification
•	Safety distance
•	Dangerous overtaking.
 

Nomad (ext.)
The main advantage, in addition to all of its functionalities, is that it can be easily integrated to any type of environment (urban or extra urban) as it can be installed directly on street furniture.
It is also non-intrusive and therefore does not require major civil engineering work.
 
Future Evolutions.
It is also designed to add additional features, to control the following
offenses:
	Different types of red light enforcement (Directional, anticipation,
flashing …)
	Bike lanes crossing
	Respect of stop signal
	Phone use while driving
	Seatbelt control
	Pedestrian priority
	Lateral distance control
	Driving in forbidden lanes.
	Automatic number plate reading
 

 







NANO-CAM
 

Nano-Cam is a parifex latest sensing solution.
It can be used in multiple situations in order to manage traffic road safety.
It detects all objects in its field of view at 360 degrees, static and moving(pedestrians, cyclist and vehicles).
It tracks different targets and can detect multiple information about them like dimension, direction, speed, distance, classification.
It’s uses can be extended to smart parking, smart
city, or even security matters for instance.
 



Key features and benefits
	Detects all static and moving objects
	Simultaneous discrimination of multiple targets.
	Vehicle profiling (dimensions, distance,
speed, etc.…)
	Large field of view (up to 360˚)
	Rapid data acquisition time
	Resistant to any extreme weather
conditions
	Immunity to lighting variations (daytime and at night)
	Light and compact
	One single sensor for multiple enforcement
